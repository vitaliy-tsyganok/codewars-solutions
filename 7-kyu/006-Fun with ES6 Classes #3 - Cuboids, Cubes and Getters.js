I. Cuboid
The object constructor for the class Cuboid should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: length, width, height and store these three values in this.length, this.width and this.height respectively.

The class Cuboid should then have a getter surfaceArea which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter volume which returns the volume of the cuboid.

II. Cube
class Cube is a subclass of class Cuboid. The constructor function of Cube should receive one argument only, its length, and use that value passed in to set this.length, this.width and this.height.

Hint: Make a call to super, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;) */

class Cuboid {
	constructor(length, width, height) {
		this.length = length;
		this.width = width;
		this.height = height;
	}
	get surfaceArea() {
		return (
			(this.length * this.width +
				this.length * this.height +
				this.width * this.height) *
			2
		);
	}
	get volume() {
		return this.length * this.width * this.height;
	}
}
class Cube extends Cuboid {
	constructor(length) {
		super(length, length, length);
	}
}
